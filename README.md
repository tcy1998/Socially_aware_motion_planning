Socially_aware_motion_planning

We  presented  a  framework  for  optimal  motion  controlof  a  flying  robot  incorporating  the  safety  perception  of humans  in  its  neighborhood. 
 The  framework  builds  upon model predictive path integral (MPPI) control  for online optimal  control  and  human’s  safety  perception  model.  
 It extends  the  earlier  results  from  for  off-line  trajectory generation  with  the  account  of  human’s  safety  perceptionto  online  setting.
